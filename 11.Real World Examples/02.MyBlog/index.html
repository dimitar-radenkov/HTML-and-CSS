                <h2>What is HTML5?</h2>
                <article>
                    <strong>HTML5</strong> is a core technology markup language of the
                    Internet used for structuring and presenting content
                    for the World Wide Web. It is the fifth revision of
                    the HTML standard (created in 1990 and standardized
                    as HTML 4 as of 1997) and, as of December 2012, is a
                    candidate recommendation of the World Wide Web
                    Consortium (W3C). Its core aims have been to improve
                    the language with support for the latest <strong>multimedia</strong>while
                    keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood
                    by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.).
                    HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also
                    XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

                    Following its immediate predecessors HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.1,
                    HTML5 is a response to the fact that the HTML and XHTML in
                    common use on the World Wide Web are a mixture of features
                    introduced by various specifications, along with those
                    introduced by software products such as Web browsers, those
                    established by common practice, and the many syntax errors in
                    existing web documents. It is also an attempt to define a
                    <strong>single markup language</strong> that can be written in either HTML
                    or XHTML syntax. It includes detailed processing models to
                    encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends,
                    improves and rationalises the markup available for documents,
                    and introduces markup and application programming interfaces
                    (APIs) for complex web applications.

                    For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a potential candidate
                    for <strong> cross-platform mobile applications</strong>.
                    Many features of
                    HTML5 have been built with the consideration of being able
                    to run on low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.
                    In December 2011, research firm Strategy Analytics forecast sales
                    of HTML5 compatible phones would top <strong>1 billion</strong> in 2013.
